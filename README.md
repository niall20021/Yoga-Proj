Meditation Lounge is a website to teach people about yoga through a few different methods.
There is online classes or a link to the youtube and instagram aswell as tiktok where videos aree posted 
demostrating different yoga poses and videos explaining the benefits of yoga and meditation.
I chose Meditation Lounge as my project as i thought it would be the most fun to design and make

Features
NavBar the navbar is sleek and a perfect size allowing users to skim through the website with ease.

Hero
I took inspiration from the Love Running Example Project I thought it looked really cool and dragged me in straight away and hoped it
would have the same effect on others, the zoom is just the right touch
The hero shows people meditating as that is what the website is based around and gives a good first impretion that they cam for when they log on

Ethos
I feel as if my project lacks a bit more useful information about how to do what the project is based about and kind of just tells you the benefits.
However I could have had a much longer list of reasons to meditate but felt I liked the design I had and thought it flowed well with the rest of the page
This part lets the users know what kind of benefits mediation can have in daily life

Online Class 
I really like the online class section i thought it came out well and it was the first section of the project I coded and styled myself without needing help from google so im quiet
proud of it
I think the colors of the text just look well and that it looked quiet realistic and could be a real part of a meditation page.
It lets the user know about our online classes where they can do a class from home

Footer
I really liked how the footer came out it looks quite clean however it is quite simplistic
it also lets people know where they can get a hold of us on social media or just watch our content

Gallery
The gallery is a collage of pictures showing people meditating and doing yoga this is soft of an encouragement to users if they are
into the same kind of things seen in the pictures they would be more inclined to sign up

Sign Up 
This is the page that will let people start they're meditation journey with meditation lounge if they choose to sign up.
