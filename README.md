- Design Choices
   - The design for Mediation Lounge was meant to be a simple and sleek design that was pleasent to look at and to navigate through, 
   We it so the first thing you see would be our branding and a large hero image of Meditation so people knew exactly
   what kind of website it was
   
   - The font Used was 'Oswald' and 'Lato' we used these fonts as they complimented eachother well and made the project gel together
   quite well.
   
- Color Scheme
  - The color scheme chosen was mainly green with small chunks of grey and white used for the long pieces of text,
  Meditation Lounge dawns the green colourway as it complimented the hero image and kind of played along quite well with,
  the theme of mediation and yoga as nature goes hand in hand with it.
  
- Images
    - All Images were optained from Pexels and are copyright free.
    
    - The images chosen were picked cautiously as I didn't want anything that would look out of place or clash with the green theme.
    
    - The Imagery really adds a good look for the site in general they help give show the sites intentions aswell as
    help show the motivations and the goal for our website.

# Credits 
- Content
   - I got alot of my content about mediation and yoga off of google.

   - I got the images from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
   
  - I got the fonts (Oswald and Lato) from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
  
# Next Steps
  - I  would like to add a another section of the website that explains in slightly more depth the benefits of yoga and meditation,
 I think by doing this it would increase the users interest in starting yoga and meditation.
 
  - I would also like to add a new section showing and demonstrating different yoga positions and types of meditation,
 I feel this would increase user acitivty with website as we could update them weekly to have users coming back.
 
  - Adding a shop to sell yoga mats and other yoga and meditation related products with our Meditation Lounge branding
 to grow the website.
